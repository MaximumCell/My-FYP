# Physics Simulation & ML Project

## Code Quality Guidelines

### Python Backend
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Handle exceptions properly
- Use meaningful variable names

### React Frontend
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use proper prop validation
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful component names

### Git Workflow
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Create feature branches for new developments
- Test code before committing
- Keep commits focused and atomic

## Development Notes
- Backend runs on Flask with CORS enabled
- Frontend uses Vite for fast development
- ML models are saved in `trained_models/` directory
- Simulation plots are generated in `plots/` directory

## Future Improvements
- Add unit tests for backend components
- Implement error boundaries in React
- Add loading states for better UX
- Implement caching for ML models
- Add API rate limiting
