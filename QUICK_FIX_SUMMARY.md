# Quick Fix Summary - DOCX Context Retrieval

## Problem

Uploaded DOCX files were not being retrieved when asking questions.

## Root Cause

**Embedding Model Mismatch**: System used different embedding models for indexing vs searching:

- Indexing: Google text-embedding-004 (768D)
- Searching: SentenceTransformer (384D)

## Solution

Made all components use the same Google text-embedding-004 model:

### Files Changed:

1. **`qdrant_client.py`** - Use Google embeddings instead of SentenceTransformer
2. **`content_extractor.py`** - Store user_id in metadata
3. **`vector_database_integration.py`** - Add user_id filtering and fix result parsing
4. **`enhanced_physics_tutor.py`** - Pass user_id through call chain (line 121 fix)
5. **`physics_advanced_routes.py`** - Extract and pass user_id in routes

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - October 2, 2025, 15:35

## Test

1. Upload a DOCX file
2. Ask a question about its content
3. Verify search logs show results found
4. Response should include content from uploaded file

## Key Changes

- Vector dimensions: 384 → 768
- Embedding model: SentenceTransformer → Google text-embedding-004
- Added user_id filtering throughout the pipeline
- Fixed parameter mismatch error in ask_physics_question()
