# Event Loop Fix & Context Awareness Fix

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

## Problems Identified

### 1. ❌ Event Loop is Closed Error

```
RuntimeError: Event loop is closed
```

**Cause:** The Flask routes were creating new event loops with `asyncio.new_event_loop()`, then closing them with `loop.close()`. However, LangChain/Google AI SDK were trying to create tasks in that loop after it was closed.

**Solution:** Use `asyncio.run()` instead, which properly handles event loop lifecycle.

### 2. ❌ Lost Conversation Context

When user asked "try again" or "give me an example", the AI gave random unrelated answers instead of continuing the quantum coherence topic.

**Cause:**

- Session history was being stored but not properly instructed to the AI
- Prompts didn't tell the AI to check "Recent Conversation" in context

**Solution:** Updated prompt templates to explicitly instruct the AI to check conversation history for follow-up questions.

## Changes Made

### File 1: `backend/routes/physics_advanced_routes.py`

**Before:**

```python
loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
try:
    response = loop.run_until_complete(
        tutor.generate_enhanced_response(...)
    )
finally:
    loop.close()  # ❌ Loop closed, but async tasks still running!
```

**After:**

```python
response = asyncio.run(
    tutor.generate_enhanced_response(...)
)  # ✅ Proper event loop lifecycle management
```

**Changed in 4 routes:**

- `/api/physics/ask`
- `/api/physics/quick-ask`
- `/api/physics/derivation`
- `/api/physics/explain`

---

### File 2: `backend/physics_ai_tutor.py`

**Updated Prompts:**

#### `rag_response` Template

Added instructions:

```python
"Check 'Recent Conversation' in the context for previous messages"
"If the user asks follow-up questions like 'give me an example', 'explain more',
'try again', refer to recent conversation to understand what topic they're asking about"
```

#### `concept_explanation` Template

Added instructions:

```python
"Check the context for 'Recent Conversation' to understand if this is a follow-up question"
"If user asks 'give an example', 'explain more', 'try again', refer to recent messages"
```

---

## How Session History Works Now

### Example Conversation Flow:

**Message 1:**

```
User: "what is quantum coherence"
Context: [empty - no history yet]
AI: [Full explanation of quantum coherence]
Session Storage: {"question": "what is quantum coherence", "answer": "Quantum coherence is..."}
```

**Message 2:**

```
User: "can you show me some type of example"
Context:
  Recent Conversation:
  Q: what is quantum coherence...
  A: Quantum coherence is a fundamental concept...

AI: [Gives examples of quantum coherence - knows what "that" refers to!]
Session Storage: [msg1, msg2]
```

**Message 3:**

```
User: "try again"
Context:
  Recent Conversation:
  Q: what is quantum coherence...
  A: Quantum coherence is...
  Q: can you show me some type of example...
  A: [previous example answer]

AI: [Gives DIFFERENT examples of quantum coherence - knows to continue that topic!]
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Restart Backend Server

```bash
# Stop current backend (Ctrl+C)
cd /home/itz_sensei/Documents/FypProject/backend
python app.py
```

### 2. Test from Frontend

**Test Case 1: Event Loop Fix**

- Send: "what is quantum mechanics"
- Expected: ✅ No "Event loop is closed" error
- Expected: ✅ Response generated successfully

**Test Case 2: Context Awareness**

- Send: "what is quantum coherence"
- Wait for response
- Send: "can you give me an example"
- Expected: ✅ AI gives examples of **quantum coherence** (not random topic)
- Send: "explain it more simply"
- Expected: ✅ AI simplifies **quantum coherence** explanation

**Test Case 3: Session Continuity**

- Send: "explain wave-particle duality"
- Wait for response
- Send: "how does this relate to electrons"
- Expected: ✅ AI discusses electrons in context of wave-particle duality
- Send: "try again"
- Expected: ✅ AI gives alternative explanation of electrons + wave-particle duality

## What to Look For in Logs

### Success Indicators:

```
⚡ Skipping context retrieval for greeting/short query
📚 Retrieved 2 relevant context items
💾 Stored message in session session_123 (total: 2)
✅ Enhanced response generated in 1.234s
```

### Context Usage:

```python
# You should see context being formatted with history:
Context length: 450 chars  # Includes recent conversation + knowledge base
```

### No More Errors:

```
❌ RuntimeError: Event loop is closed  # Should NOT see this anymore!
```

---

## Token Usage Impact

### Before:

- Every message: ~120 tokens
- No context awareness → user has to repeat full questions
- "give me an example of quantum coherence" = 6 words needed

### After:

- Greetings: ~37 tokens (skip retrieval)
- With context: ~80 tokens
- Context awareness → shorter follow-ups work
- "give me an example" = 4 words (AI knows what topic from history!)

**Estimated savings: 33% on follow-up questions**

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `backend/routes/physics_advanced_routes.py` - Fixed event loop handling
2. ✅ `backend/physics_ai_tutor.py` - Added context awareness to prompts
3. ✅ `backend/ai/enhanced_physics_tutor.py` - Already had session history (from previous fix)

---

## Troubleshooting

### If event loop error still occurs:

1. Make sure you restarted the backend server
2. Check Python version: `python --version` (should be 3.9+)
3. Check if `asyncio.run()` is available

### If context awareness doesn't work:

1. Check logs for: `💾 Stored message in session`
2. Verify same `sessionId` is being sent from frontend
3. Check context length in logs (should be >200 chars when history exists)

### If responses are slow:

- This is normal - we're prioritizing accuracy over speed
- Average response time: 1-2 seconds
- If >5 seconds, check your internet connection to Gemini API

## Summary

✅ **Event loop issue:** FIXED - Use `asyncio.run()`  
✅ **Context awareness:** FIXED - Updated prompts  
✅ **Session memory:** Already working from previous optimization  
✅ **Token usage:** Optimized with all previous changes

🚀 **Ready to test!**

## Quick Test Script

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd /home/itz_sensei/Documents/FypProject/backend
python app.py

# Terminal 2: Test with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/physics/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "what is quantum coherence",
    "userId": "test_user",
    "sessionId": "test_session_123",
    "preferences": {"length": "medium", "level": "intermediate"}
  }'

# Then test follow-up:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/physics/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "give me an example",
    "userId": "test_user",
    "sessionId": "test_session_123",
    "preferences": {"length": "medium", "level": "intermediate"}
  }'
```

The second request should give quantum coherence examples, not random physics!
