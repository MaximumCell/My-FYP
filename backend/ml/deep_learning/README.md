Deep learning models and utilities for the project.

Add training scripts, model definition files, and inference wrappers here.

Suggested structure:

- models/ (model definition files)
- training/ (training scripts)
- inference/ (inference wrappers)
- utils/ (data loaders, preprocessing helpers)

Dependencies: prefer TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch pinned in backend/requirements.txt as needed.
