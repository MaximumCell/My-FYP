# **App Name**: PhysicsLab

## Core Features:

- Model Training (Regression): Upload a CSV file, select a target column and a regression model, then train the model and display performance metrics (MSE, MAE, R2). Provides a tool for model downloads.
- Model Training (Classification): Upload a CSV file, select a target column and a classification model, then train the model and display performance metrics. Provides a tool for model downloads.
- Model Recommendation: Upload a CSV file to get a recommended model.
- Model Testing (Regression): Input new data as JSON to test a regression model and view the predicted values.
- Model Testing (Classification): Input new data as JSON to test a classification model and view the predicted class, probability and class names.
- Physics Simulation: Select a pre-defined or input a custom equation, define variables and ranges, run a physics simulation, and view the generated plot.
- AI Tutor (Coming Soon): A chat-based AI tutor to assist with physics concepts (feature coming soon).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #29ABE2 (RGB) - A bright, clean blue suggesting science and innovation.
- Background color: #F0F8FF (RGB) - A very light, desaturated blue providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: #FF69B4 (RGB) - A vivid pink that is analogous to the primary blue and offers strong visual contrast for highlighting calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif. For a modern and neutral feel, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro', monospace.  Specifically for code snippets.
- Use a set of clear, scientific-themed icons for navigation and feature representation.
- Emphasize a clean and responsive layout, optimized for clarity and ease of use across devices.
- Use subtle animations to enhance user interaction and provide feedback during actions such as loading and data processing.
